# Home is Where Your Heart Beats

yhome is a 'fake' brand that I designed and created for learning purposes. This project features `OOP paradigm in JavaScript.`The properties data is fetched from a class constructor, as well as filter options, that get updated automatically. The general concept of this exercise was to do everything programmatically, minimizing hard coding to zero.

Because I love creative tasks, creating new brand concepts right next to solving programming problems is always exciting.

It was a great experience and I am happy to have it accomplished. Massive thanks to `unsplash.com` for an amazing interior design photos!
